This project is a Pascal interpreter/compiler in Python. 

Please use 'compiler_project.py --help' for more information on how to execute the program. 

It executes a subset of Pascal codes including arithmetic operation, writes, if statements, and procedures. It supports integer, real, boolean, and string.
Supports to inputs, functions, and loops are under development.

Like a real compiler, it consists of lexer, parser, and interpreter. It also simulates the Call Stack.

The main data structures used are stacks, tables, and Abstract Syntax Tree.

A set of Unittest cases are also provided. These cases are not complete, they were used during development for a few features.
